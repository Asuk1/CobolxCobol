# Modernizing a Legacy COBOL Accounting System with Python and GitHub Copilot

This project demonstrates how to modernize a legacy COBOL accounting system by converting its business logic into clean, functional Python code, leveraging GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted development.

## Project Overview

- **Original Source:** [continuous-copilot/modernize-legacy-cobol-app](https://github.com/continuous-copilot/modernize-legacy-cobol-app)
- **Goal:** Transform COBOL code into maintainable Python modules.
- **Approach:** Use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code to assist with code conversion, refactoring, and testing.

## Features

- Account management: view balance, credit, debit, exit.
- Modular Python code structure.
- Unit tests for all core functionalities.

## Code Structure

- `accountsystem.py` — Main Python implementation of the accounting logic.
- `test_account.py` — Unit tests for the Python code.
- `test_account.cob` — Unit tests for the Cobol code.
- Legacy COBOL files are preserved for reference.

## How Copilot Helps

- Converts COBOL logic to Python functions and classes.
- Suggests idiomatic Python code and error handling.
- Assists in writing unit tests and documentation.

## My Migration Process

### Phase 1: Research and Understanding

I started by thoroughly reading the bootstrap project documentation (`G-ING-900_bootstrap.pdf`) to understand the assignment requirements. The key mandate was clear: modernize COBOL code using Python with GitHub Copilot assistance.

Next, I studied two critical resources:

1. **[Original COBOL Repository](https://github.com/continuous-copilot/modernize-legacy-cobol-app)** - The legacy codebase to be modernized
2. **[GitHub Blog Article](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/modernizing-legacy-code-with-github-copilot-tips-and-examples/)** - Official guidance on legacy code modernization with Copilot

The GitHub article was particularly illuminating, highlighting the core challenges of legacy code modernization:

#### Legacy Code Challenges Identified

- **Technical Debt**: Decades of accumulated hardcoded logic, sprawling dependencies, and "temporary" fixes that became permanent
- **Integration Challenges**: Misaligned APIs, clashing data formats, and fragile system interdependencies
- **Data Migration and Compatibility**: Outdated data formats requiring careful conversion without breaking existing functionality
- **Cost and Resourcing**: Time-intensive process requiring skilled engineers and organizational buy-in
- **Performance and Scalability**: Legacy architecture limitations affecting modern performance requirements
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Code written before modern security standards, lacking protection against current threats
- **Testing Complexity**: Risk of breaking unknown dependencies with each modification

### Phase 2: Copilot Strategy and Best Practices

Based on the GitHub article recommendations, I adopted a focused approach using **slash commands in Copilot Chat**. These shortcut commands proved incredibly helpful for performing both simple and complex functions—just highlight the code you want to perform an action on, then enter the slash command in Copilot Chat.

The four essential slash commands I focused on were:

- **`/explain`** - explains how the code in your active editor works
- **`/tests`** - generates unit tests for the selected code
- **`/fixTestFailure`** - finds and fixes failing tests
- **`/fix`** - finds and fixes general problems in the selected code

I deliberately focused on these commands as they were the only ones I considered essential for this project. Other chat participants like `@github` didn't directly interfere with the migration process.

Following the article's core recommendations:
- **Focus on individual functions or modules** before diving into the entire system
- **Write tests first**: Before changing a single line of code, ensure you have tests that validate the current behavior (test-driven development approach)
- **Always review Copilot's suggestions**: While Copilot's suggestions are accurate and insightful, human oversight is essential

### Phase 3: COBOL Analysis and Understanding

#### Environment Setup
I began by installing GnuCOBOL to run the original COBOL files:

```bash
# Install COBOL compiler
yay -S gnucobol
# Compile and test original COBOL application
cobc -x main.cob operations.cob data.cob -o accountsystem
./accountsystem
```

#### Code Analysis with Copilot
I started by using `/explain` to understand each COBOL file individually. However, I still needed a better understanding of how these three files work together in the executable. This is where Copilot's `@workspace` command proved incredibly helpful.

The `@workspace` command in Copilot Chat allows you to ask questions about your entire codebase, including finding code and making plans for complex edits. I used `@workspace` to:
- Generate a data flow diagram in Mermaid format for clear visualization
- Create a comprehensive test plan, which I documented in `TESTPLAN.md`

#### Behavioral Testing
Following the **"Write tests first"** approach, I implemented test-driven development. Before changing any code, I established baseline functionality by thoroughly testing the COBOL application's behavior. Using the `/tests` slash command in Copilot Chat, I created tests that acted as a safety net, ensuring any changes wouldn't accidentally break critical functionality.

### Phase 4: Python Conversion - Challenges and Adaptations

#### Initial Approach
I began converting the COBOL files to Python following the recommended strategy: **"Focus on individual functions or modules before diving into the entire system"**. This incremental approach was designed to build momentum and confidence gradually.

#### Challenges Encountered

**Technical Limitations:**
- **Rate Limiting**: I hit GitHub Copilot's monthly free tier limit, encountering network errors that required upgrading to GitHub Pro to continue development

**Prompt Engineering Difficulties:**
- **Vague Prompts**: Sometimes my requests were too general, leading to unclear or inappropriate responses
- **Over-elaborate Prompts**: Other times, overly detailed prompts confused Copilot, resulting in responses that missed the mark
- **Communication Issues**: Copilot occasionally misunderstood my requirements, necessitating multiple iterations

**Quality Control Issues:**
Through manual review and asking Copilot to review its own suggestions, I discovered that some generated code didn't meet quality standards or didn't accurately replicate the COBOL behavior.

#### Adapted Solution
Due to these challenges, I adapted my approach and made a pragmatic decision: consolidate all converted functionality into a single Python file that maintains the same behavior as the original COBOL system. Similarly, I consolidated all tests into a single test file.

To ensure clarity and maintainability, I added extensive comments throughout both files to:
- Explain the logic behind each section
- Separate different functional areas  
- Document the relationship between Python code and original COBOL behavior
- Provide context for future maintenance


### Key Copilot Prompts for Migration:
```bash/ 
explain #file:main.cob #file:operations.cob #file:data.cob
``` 

```bash
Can you create a high-level overview of the app and explain how these files are linked? Explain in both high-level overview but also a 3 lines overview
```


```bash
@workspace can you create a sequence diagram of the app showing the data flow of the app. Please create this in mermaid format so that I can render this in a markdown file.
```

```bash
@workspace Create a complete test plan for this COBOL application.

Format: Markdown table with:  
- Test ID  
- Description  
- Prerequisites  
- Steps  
- Expected Result  
- Empty columns for Actual Result and Status  

Cover all cases: normal, boundary, error.  
Convert this to markdown syntax to insert as a new file TESTPLAN.md
```

```bash
/tests Generate comprehensive unit tests for all Cobol files that validate the TESTPLAN.md
```

```bash
/fix and /fixTestFailure
```


```bash
Convert #file:data.cob to Python, maintaining exact same behavior for data persistence and validation.
```

```bash
Convert #file:operations.cob to Python, maintaining exact same behavior for data persistence and validation.
```

```bash
Convert #file:main.cob to Python, maintaining exact same behavior for data persistence and validation.
```

```bash
/tests Generate comprehensive unit tests for this Python class that validate identical behavior to the original COBOL implementation.
```
