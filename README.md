# Modernizing a Legacy COBOL Accounting System with Python and GitHub Copilot

This project demonstrates how to modernize a legacy COBOL accounting system by converting its business logic into clean, functional Python code, leveraging GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted development.

## Project Overview

- **Original Source:** [continuous-copilot/modernize-legacy-cobol-app](https://github.com/continuous-copilot/modernize-legacy-cobol-app)
- **Goal:** Transform COBOL code into maintainable Python modules.
- **Approach:** Use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code to assist with code conversion, refactoring, and testing.

## Features

- Account management: view balance, credit, debit, exit.
- Modular Python code structure.
- Unit tests for all core functionalities.

## Code Structure

- `accountsystem.py` — Main Python implementation of the accounting logic.
- `test_account.py` — Unit tests for the Python code.
- Legacy COBOL files are preserved for reference.

## How Copilot Helps

- Converts COBOL logic to Python functions and classes.
- Suggests idiomatic Python code and error handling.
- Assists in writing unit tests and documentation.
